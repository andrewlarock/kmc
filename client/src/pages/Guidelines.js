          Thank you for contributing to our platform by submitting a course review! Your feedback is invaluable for helping other students make informed decisions about their classes. To ensure your review is constructive and helpful, please adhere to the following guidelines:

          Student Guidelines:
          </div>
          <div className="guidelines-subheader">
          <b>Be Honest:</b>&nbsp;
          Share your genuine experience with the course and instructor. Authentic feedback is essential for other students to gauge the course's value. Avoid exaggerating or minimizing your experiences; provide an accurate representation of what to expect.<br></br><br></br>
          
          <b>Be Fair:</b>&nbsp;
          Evaluate all aspects of the course, including workload, teaching style, and course materials. Consider both the positive and negative elements. A balanced review helps readers understand the full scope of the course.<br></br><br></br>
          
          <b>Focus on Relevant Details:</b>&nbsp;
          Highlight specific aspects of the course such as lectures, assignments, exams, and the professor’s teaching style. Providing concrete examples allows others to better understand your experience and the course’s structure.<br></br><br></br>
          
          <b>Use Constructive Criticism:</b>&nbsp;
          If you have negative feedback, present it in a constructive manner. For instance, instead of simply stating that a course was "bad," explain what made it difficult (e.g., unclear assignments, pacing issues) and suggest ways it could be improved.<br></br><br></br>
          
          <b>Be Respectful:</b>&nbsp;
          Maintain a respectful tone throughout your review. Even if you had a negative experience, it’s important to treat the professor and fellow students with courtesy. Avoid personal attacks or inflammatory language.

          Prohibited Content:
          </div>
          <div className="guidelines-subheader">
          <b>Profanity or Foul Language:</b>&nbsp;
          Avoid using inappropriate or offensive language in your review. This includes swear words, slurs, and any derogatory terms. A professional tone enhances the credibility of your feedback.<br></br><br></br>
          
          <b>Make Personal Threats:</b>&nbsp;
          Do not include any threats or aggressive comments directed at the instructor or other students. Personal safety and respect are paramount in any educational environment.<br></br><br></br>
          
          <b>Reveal Personal Information:</b>&nbsp;
          Protect your privacy and the privacy of others by refraining from disclosing personal information (e.g., full names, email addresses, phone numbers). This helps maintain a safe space for all users.<br></br><br></br>
          
          <b>Submit Irrelevant Reviews:</b>&nbsp;
          Stay on topic and focus solely on your course experience. Avoid discussing unrelated matters (e.g., university politics, campus events) that do not pertain to the course content or instruction.<br></br><br></br>
          
          <b>Submit Fake Reviews:</b>&nbsp;
          Avoid posting reviews for courses you haven’t taken or based on hearsay. Authentic experiences are crucial, as they provide the most accurate insights to prospective students.<br></br><br></br>
          
          <b>Discriminate or Harass:</b>&nbsp;
          Refrain from using any discriminatory language or making harassing comments regarding race, gender, sexuality, or religion. Our community thrives on diversity and respect; fostering a welcoming environment is essential.<br></br><br></br>
          
          <b>Duplicate Content:</b>&nbsp;
          Do not submit multiple reviews for the same course. Each course should have only one review per student to ensure fair representation and clarity in feedback.<br></br><br></br>
          
          <b>Post Spam or Promotional Content:</b>&nbsp;
          Do not use the review section to advertise or promote other courses, businesses, or services. Your review should focus on the course and its merits, not as a platform for marketing.

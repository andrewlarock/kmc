            After landing on your school page, you can search for a specific course within your school’s page. Use the search bar that says “Find a class” and start typing in the course code and number. If the course has already been reviewed, it will autofill as you type. If it’s not yet reviewed, you can manually enter it by pressing enter after typing it. Here's a guide on how to properly format the course information:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Course Code:</strong> &nbsp;A short combination of 2-4 letters (usually representing the department)</li>
              <li><strong>Course Number:</strong> &nbsp;A 2-4 digit number specific to the class</li>
            </ul>
            Each university may structure their course names slightly differently. For example, valid formats might look like this:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>ENG101</strong> &nbsp;for an English 101 class. The code is ENG and the number is 101.</li>
              <li><strong>MATH2010</strong> &nbsp;for a higher-level mathematics course. The code is MATH and the number is 2010.</li>
              <li><strong>CS50</strong> &nbsp;for a higher-level mathematics course. The code is CS and the number is 50.</li>
            </ul>
            If you're unsure of the exact course code and number, refer to your university’s course catalog for accurate information:
          </div>
          <div className='about-image-container'>
            <img src={require('../css/images/catalog.png')} alt="Catalog" className="catalog-image" />
          </div>
          <div className='about-info-stext' style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>
            When searching for a specific class, it’s important to only use the <b>course code</b> and <b>course number</b>. Some schools may include additional information after the course number, such as "LR," "LAB," or other designations, like in the example above.
            In these cases, make sure to leave out the extra designations (like "LR" or "LAB") when typing the course into the search bar. For example, to search for PHY 107LR, you would simply enter PHY 107. The only required format is the course code (e.g., PHY) followed by the course number (e.g., 107). If the class is a lab-designated class, add the "Lab Required" tag to your review to help other students identify that the course involves lab work.
